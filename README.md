# Loyalty Program App
Code challenge from Aerolab

## Dependencies
* React
* Axios
* Sass

## To run locally
* Run `yarn install`
* And then `yarn start`
* For simplicity the .env file has been already loaded
  * It needs to have the key `REACT_APP_API_URL` set to the proper api url
  * And also the `REACT_APP_API_KEY` with the proper api key

----

#### A few words for the challenge
* I think the date since a product is available is missing. It's needed to implement `most recent` filter
* `buy-blue.svg` and `buy-white.svg` don't have the same sizes
